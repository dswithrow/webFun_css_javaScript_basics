        <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
        <p id="intro">
            JavaScript is a cross-platform, objected-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a
            variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language, allowing maximum flexibility for developers to
            take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or
            Node server), and can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over
            them.

        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://google.com/">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing
                data values. Imagine a cup you fill with coffee; the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All
                Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.
                <span>var x;</span>
            </li>
            <li><a href="http://google.com/">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript
                variables. Our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The =
                assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x = 10;</span>
            </li>
            <li><a href="http://google.com/">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept. To be able to operate
                on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives:
                Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number -
                <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array -
                <span>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name:'Jane',lastname:'Doe'}</span>
            </li>
            <li><a href="http://google.com/">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions
                for different decisions, hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met.
                You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional
                statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else
                    if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we
                execute this block of code;

            </li>
            <li><a href="http://google.com/">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming
                language, but they all essentially do the same thing: repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you
                have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!

            </li>
            <li><a href="http://google.com/">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call
                our function, this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example,
                imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea. We open up the instruction manual and get started.
                First we screw the legs to the table top. Next, we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished
                our instructions. Sadly, there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and
                over again.
